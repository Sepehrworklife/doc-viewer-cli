# Contribute
First of all I'm very thankfull to you guys all for concidering to contribute to this project.


## Developing
If you already cloned the repository and you know that you need to deep dive in the code, here are some guidelines to set up your environment.
<br>
### :red_circle: IMPORTANT! :red_circle:
Make sure that after issue has been assigned to you create branch for that issue after that do your changes and then make a pull request from created branch to the master.
<br>

### Virtual environment with `venvÂ¶`:
You can create a virtual environment in a directory using Python's venv module:
```
$ python -m venv venv
```
That will create a directory ./venv/ with the Python binaries and then you will be able to install packages for that isolated environment.
<br>

### Activate the environment
Activate the new environment with:
```
$ source ./venv/bin/activate (on Linux)
$ .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 (on Windows PowerShell)
```
To check if it worked, use:
```
$ which pip
some/directory/doc-viewer-cli/venv/bin/pip
```
if it shows the `pip` binary at `venv/bin/pip` then it worked. \
Make sure you have the latest pip version on your virtual environment to avoid errorss on the next steps:
```
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Install packages
Use below pip command so you retreive required packages:
```
$ pip install -r /path-to-project/requirements/development.txt
```

### Run application
First of all change directory to `src`:
```
$ cd /path-to-project/src
```
After that simply run application within you command line:
```
$ python application.py [OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]
```
If you dont have a clue for arguments or options use:
```
$ python application.py --help
```

## Testing
For testing the project simply use code below at the root of project:
```
$ make test
```
p.s: Test cases are not complete yet.
